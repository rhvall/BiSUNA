[GymEnv]
; The number of running environments should match the thread count defined
; in the program config "ThreadNumber". Also, have in mind that this property
; should not include an special number, because the application automatically
; will add a sequence at the end of the string. For example, with the value below
; at time of execution, it will have "unix:///tmp/gym-uds-socket", with "0"
; appended, and matching the thread number starting at 0.
Socket = unix:///tmp/gym-uds-socket
